## Selecting Your Audience

### Step 1: Choose Your Recipients

Toast provides several audience options:

#### All Subscribers
- Sends to everyone who has opted into marketing emails
- Best for major announcements or universal promotions

#### Segmented Audiences
Create targeted segments based on:

1. **Visit Frequency**
   - Frequent guests (visited 5+ times)
   - Occasional guests (visited 2-4 times)
   - New guests (visited once)
   - Lapsed guests (haven't visited in 60+ days)

2. **Order History**
   - Online ordering customers
   - Dine-in customers
   - Catering customers

3. **Spending Habits**
   - High spenders (average check over $X)
   - Rewards members

4. **Custom Segments**
   - Create based on specific criteria
   - Combine multiple filters

### Step 2: Estimate Your Reach

- Toast will show the estimated number of recipients
- Review this number to ensure it aligns with your expectations
- Larger audiences = more impact but less personalization

### Step 3: Exclude Segments (Optional)

- Exclude recent purchasers from discount emails
- Exclude guests who received an email recently (prevent fatigue)
